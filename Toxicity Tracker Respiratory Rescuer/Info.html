                <li>Medical nebulizers - I am used for controlled inhalation of medications in respiratory therapy.</li>
                <li>Air fresheners - I release chemicals that are typically present in very low concentrations.</li>
                <li>Saline solution - I mimic the body's natural fluids, providing a gentle and non-irritating environment.</li>
                <li>Steam from boiling water - I am composed of water vapor, which, when inhaled, provides moisture to the respiratory tract.</li>
                <li>Perfumes - I have volatile components that are designed to evaporate quickly, minimizing prolonged exposure.</li>
                <li>Candles - My combustion process produces minimal harmful byproducts.</li>
                <li>Wood smoke - Matters and irritants in me are present in minimal concentrations.</li>
                <li>Printer emissions - Inhaling trace amounts of emissions from me in typical use is generally safe.</li>
                <li>Dust - My particles are typically larger and heavier and are likely to be trapped in the upper respiratory tract.</li>
                <li>Isopropyl alcohol - I evaporate quickly, reducing the likelihood of prolonged inhalation.</li>

              <ul>

                <li>Lighter fluid - I contain butane and can cause nausea.</li>
                <li>Cigarette Smoke - I can give you a chronic cough.</li>
                <li>Pesticides - I can cause irritation and inflammation in the airways, leading to difficulty in breathing.</li>
                <li>Chlorine - I can form hydrochloric acid that will irritate and damage the respiratory tissues.</li>
                <li>Marker fumes - I have volatile organic compounds which, when inhaled, can cause coughing.</li>
                <li>Acetone - I can inflame the mucous membranes in the nose and throat.</li>
