                <li>Printer emissions - Inhaling trace amounts of emissions from me in typical use is generally safe.</li>
                <li>Vicks Inhaler - I can stimulate mucus production and airway inflammation.</li>
                <li>Isopropyl alcohol - I evaporate quickly, reducing the likelihood of prolonged inhalation.</li>
